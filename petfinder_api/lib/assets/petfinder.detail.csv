Meet Lady Bug! This gorgeous brindle pittie was found living in a car, left alone, before being saved by her foster. Super smart, Lady Bug already knows many commands, including 'sit', 'stay', 'come', 'lay', and also understands that when you tell her 'no' it means to stop doing something...and she actually stops! Oh, and she's housetrained! A huge people lover, this sweet girl wants nothing more than a forever family to cuddle up with and show her what it feels like to really be loved. While we think she'll be great in most any home, she's not the biggest fan of small dogs, so a home where she can be an only dog-child. Can you give her the forever home she's been waiting for?

King is a total lover 5 years old with some abandonment issues. He is more of a ladies man, but warms up to men with time.  He loves attention but is somewhat like a cat; he wants it when he wants it. With time and lots of patience, King is super loyal and loving.

He has some handling sensitivities. For example, he needs to be professionally groomed.  He loves being outdoors,  is  great with other dogs and loves socializing, but would probably do best as the only-pet or one other dog. He shouldnât be left alone for long periods of time â that is when another dog would definitely help his abandonment issues.

Crackers is such a lovely little guy! He is about 3 years old and 10 lbs, and he's got a gorgeous yellow coat with long delicate legs. He must have come from a  rough background and can be quite shy at first, but he's a wonderful little boy once he warms up.He adores being in your lap, and he's good with other dogs that he knows but can be a little afraid/choosy with new dogs at first. He would do best in a quiet grownups only home with someone who has the patience to give this boy the chance he deserves to open up and blossom into the amazing dog he's meant to be! His foster mom says: âCrackers is doing great! He's such a good boy!  I'd say he's really just working at standard things for warming up to a new home. Heâs okay with most people, just a little shaky if we sneak up on him too quickly.  He's very affectionate toward us and and especially loves my husband.  He likes to lay on the couch with us and watch TV.  He gets super excited to see us when we get home and in the mornings, etc.  I'm trying to remember how he is with meeting new  people, but he's really just been around us and people walking by with dogs.  He did meet my parents once but I can't remember the initial meet, no concerns though. He may need a little help warming up to other dogs. He is very interested in other dogs and when they approach from a distance he'll stop and watch them. When they approach up close he's still interested because he moves forward rather than backward, then at the same time has tale between legs, shakes and growls like heâs afraid. He and Lilee, my dog, are doing good together though, he's never been afraid of her not even on day 1 (Lilee's pretty polite and mild tempered when meeting dogs).  They both fetch (we didn't teach him, he knew how on his own). During walks he is a little shaky on the leash at certain times like around loud noises, But, with a quick command he goes and even moves at a great pace when we are all moving together. Heâs totally housebroken, only one accident in the house (first night), heâs also crate trained. Heâs super quiet and never barks. All in all, he's a really wonderful boy :)â

Lady Bug is in a private foster home, and is not adoptable through Muddy Paws Rescue. If you are interested in Lucy, please contact Michael at michael@michaeltsmith.net or Camp Canine at campcanineny@gmail.com.

Meet Lucy! Lucy is 4 year old, 35lbs mini pittie! Lucy loves being near her people at all times and has to be touching you. She is such a little bundle of love. She also is the best Netflix and chill buddy since she can be a little bit of a couch potato at times. Lucy is a great, sweet, loving dog who is just overly anxious in the city. Oddly she hasn't really had issues with fireworks or thunderstorms... just loud city noise. When on her quiet street or in her apartment, she's totally fine. But when walking on a busy street (like an avenue here in the city) she gets anxious really fast. This means she gets really reactive and defensive (she has gone through multiple trainings and such to help her get over this but it seems this sweet girl is just not meant to be a city girl). Because of this, Lucy is looking for a loving home in a quieter area, preferably the suburbs. Her ideal home would be in a quieter area with happy adults who will give her time to get over her initial timidness since once she warms up to you she is the biggest lovebug ever. Lucy gets along with most other dogs, is fully vetted and spayed.

MOLLY is a sweet 1/1.5 year old Blue Heeler.  Here is a little bio from her foster mama:

Molly is an amazing dog. She is extremely smart and has a wonderful disposition. She is obedient and understands ""no"", ""sit"" and is picking up ""wait"" when our other dogs are getting treats so she waits her turn. We caught her taking a blanket from one of the dog crates into her own. Can't express how uniquely smart she is. Her potential with the right family is endless.

She doesn't bark even when we have our poodles barking. She sits politely before going out at the door and walks without pulling. She wasn't going pee outside no matter how many times we took her out but now with just one day in PA, she's learned that's where she has to go. She's great with other dogs and just wants to play with them. She has no food or treat aggression. We are able to pet her while she eats and she's quickly learned to release toys from her mouth if you tell her. She should definitely be in a home with at least a medium activity level. She's a sweetheart and enjoys being cradled and of course a good belly rub. Molly is starting to form a beautiful bond with Buster and we only wish we could keep her.

Justin, this adorable fuzzy poodle, was recently found abandoned in a dog run covered in totally matted, dirty fur. A wonderful animal lover got him to a nearby vet where he's been cared for for three weeks... and now we've taken him in! Justin is about 15 lbs (but could lose al little weight), around 4 to 7 years old, very friendly, great with other animals, pretty mellow, great on a leash, and housebroken! AND HE HAS A MOHAWK!!!

It seems impossible, but this absurdly adorable striped Shih Tzu has been up for adoption for over a year. Mabel is a gentle, kind, affectionate, and grateful girl that is easy going, low energy, and wonderful with other animals... the ""catch"" is, she is about 12 years old, partially blind, and diabetic. We know, it sounds like a problem package, but she's actually a very easy girl and just needs a specific diet, daily insulin injections (which she takes like a champ!), and occasional vet checkups. She gets around well as long as she has a little guidance. Mabel is in an awesome foster home that nursed her from a bald bag of bones (when we originally rescued her) back to a healthy fluffy senior -- NOW, she needs a forever home where she can live out her golden years napping in someone's lap, ideally with another dog in the home too as she just loves to cuddle with her foster doggy siblings. Her foster mom says: ""Mabel is the sweetest golden girl and has been by far our favorite foster! She gets along great with everyone she meets from dogs, to cats, and humans of all ages! She has a very calm and sweet temperament with some cute old lady sass here and there! She enjoys lots of cuddles with humans and her foster siblings (especially with our pittie). Sometimes she will do this cute little whimper when she needs some cuddle time. She loves to eat and get lots of treats! Mabel also enjoys short walks and lounging around on soft surfaces (or blue ikea bags haha). Her special needs care is super easy with her positive attitude. She takes eyedrops daily (to help with her dry eye) and patiently waits for her daily insulin shots after her meals (even looks forward to them since it means treat time!). She is partially blind, but navigates very well. Mabel would really benefit from a home that is low key, has another dog to cuddle with and that will spoil her with love she deserves! She is a true gem of a little lady that can't wait to meet you!"" Interested in adopting? Submit an application at socialteesnyc.org!
